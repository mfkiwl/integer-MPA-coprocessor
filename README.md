# integer-MPA-coprocessor
Open-Source Coprocessor for Integer Multiple Precision Arithmetic

1. Introduction

The purpose of the project is to develop the VHDL code for FPGA allowing to accelerate MPA computations. The developed device should work as a coprocessor for standard CPU. As a starting point, the basic arithmetic operations are chosen for implementation in FPGA, i.e., addition, subtraction, multiplication. The device should support the integer operations based thesign-magnitude representation of data (i.e., it should be similar to the GMP standard).
